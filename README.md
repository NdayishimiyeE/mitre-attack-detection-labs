# MITRE ATT&CK Lab 

## Introduction

This repository documents my hands-on work completing MITRE ATT&CK–aligned labs.

The purpose of this project is to strengthen my ability to:

- Analyze adversary behavior
- Map activity to MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques
- Develop SOC-level detection strategies
- Practice investigation workflows using log evidence

Each lab is organized by MITRE ATT&CK tactic and includes:
- Technique overview
- Observed behavior
- Detection considerations
- Investigation approach
- Lessons learned
